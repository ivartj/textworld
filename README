textworld
=========

textworld is a telnet server that provides a virtually infinite,
collaborative canvas for text.

To build from Github source:

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make all

Run with:

    src/textworld

Which should make a world of text accessible at port 12345.


IMPORTANT: This program is written in C and has not gone through
           thorough security auditing. Bear this in mind while running
           a server.
